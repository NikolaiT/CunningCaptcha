Title: CREATE YOUR OWN FONT WITHOUT ANY TOOLS!

As promised previously in my last article, I will guide you through the creation process of a new font. I will use the glyphs of my font to draw captchas and incorportate the implementation in my brand new captcha plugin for wordpress. There are already quite a few captcha plugins, some of them are better than mine (ReCAPTCHA usage translates books and thus solves two problems at the same time), others [Link] are worse, because they are too easy to crack.

But in this article I will center the focus entirely on the font and abstract from it's future usage in the captcha.

<h1>Technical background of fonts</h1>

A logical start of font creation is to answer the question of what type of font we are going to create. But lets first introduce some concepts that are of importance when it comes to font design.
In short: A font is a collection of glyphs. Each glyph has a shape and there are various ways of describing that shape. You can imagine a glyph as a instanteation of a character. Whereas  a character is a conecpt a glyph is a reification of that concept. When we speak of glyphs, we are interested in the form, design and view of the character, not the character itself as a carrier of information. Now in our latin font, there is a one-to-one mapping of glyphs to characters. But in some other languages there might be different glyphs for a character depending on the adjacent characters (For instance in arabic some characters have four or more different glyphs). 

Now lets answer which font format we are going to choose. Essentially, there are three different font type formats, each of them with different advantages and problems. They are:

<ul>
	<li><em>Bitmap fonts</em> Fonts in this format are described in a array of pixels (a bitmap). You can imagine the array as a two-dimensional coordinate system and when you want to rasterize the font you just copy that array in the coordinate system of the output canvas. The glyph information is kinda unflexible, because there is not an easy and intuitive way to resize the single glyphs and therefore there are usually different bitmaps for the different sizes of glyphs.
	<li><em>Outline fonts</em>This format takes a different approach. Here we won't store the actual coordinates of glyphs. Instead we store the information of how to draw the glyphs as a mathematical function with different paramters which control the shape (cursive, bold, normal) and size (12px, 36px, npx) and other aspects of the appearance of each glyph. An outline is a set of contours or paths, and the paths consist of Bézier spines and simple lines. The splines are normally quadratic or cubic bezier curves. Therefore the glyphs are only rastered when the application already determined all the parameters. Outline fonts are very dynamic and powerful, but require lots more of processing power when compared to bitmap fonts. Postscript and truetype fonts are examples of this format.
	<li><em>Stroke fonts</em> Are stroked fonts, where each stem of the glyph is represented by one line down the center of the stem, and the line is later drawn with a certain width [Add citation]. I am not particularly interested in stroke fonts, but in the case you are, just read it up in the interwebs [Add link to helpful resources here].

I will develop a outline font, but compared to TrueType/OpenType/PostScript fonts in a very basic format and not with the full alphabet (Just around 10-15 characters). Furthermore I will use quadratic Bézier splines. The glyphs will be of very very easy shape (Each glyph will essentially be onle a line), but for some characters I will add some additional parameters to illustrate the entire possibilities.

Now in the case you shrug your shoulders when I mention Bézier curves, consider reading my previous blog article [Link here] that also includes a bunch of links to very nice resources. Be aware that quite a bit of math hides behind Bézier splines and that I won't use heavily optimized algorithms for plotting the splines, simply because I don't have the mathematical knowledge and skill to do it.

If you also want to create your own fonts and you want to really use them everywhere and save them in a format such as PostScript, SVG or TrueType/OpenType, consider the application FontForge [Link goes here], that helps you quite a lot and bewares you of the quirky low level plotting algorithms...For my font, I just use FontForge to get a look and feel experience of how my glyphs sould look like, since it's kinda hard to think entirely in points and control points of Bézier splines without actually drawing them ;)

<h1> Special needs </h1>

Since I use my font for captchas, I will need some mechanism to blur the glyphs, change the color and rotate glyphs and implement random space between single glyphs and many more ways to harden the reverse engineering process of finding a way to crack the captcha. Cracking means to map a set of pixels to a specific character. This process should become hard enough, such that the effort isn't worth it , but one should keep in mind that the resulting image shouldn't be to unrecognizable, since it frankly pisses users off, when they need to decipher them.
